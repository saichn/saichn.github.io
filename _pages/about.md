I am an accomplished software developer with over 8 years of experience in designing and optimizing high-performance applications. My expertise spans performance optimization, CI/CD pipeline enhancement, and the development of Python automation frameworks.

Holding dual master's degrees in Computer Science (Machine Learning) and Electrical Engineering (VLSI), I am keen to leverage my extensive software development background as I transition into the Machine Learning and AI fields. My professional journey at leading technology companies, including Qualcomm and Intel, has honed my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions that drive impactful results.
